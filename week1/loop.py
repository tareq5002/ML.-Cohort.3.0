## simple for loop using

fruits = ["mango", "banana", "lichi"]

for x in fruits:          ## fruits index in the X variable
    print(x)

## range code

for x in range (11):
    print(x) 

    ## nested for loop


number = 1

for i in range (3):

        for j in range (3):
            print(number, end = " ")

            number += 1
            print()
